**1. DO YOUR RESEARCH**

There are so many boot camps out there. Some with great reputations. A lot with bad. I chose my boot camp - General Assembly - based on several friends' recommendations as well as having a global reputation and network. My boot camp provided a great learning structure and ample career support post-graduation as well as warm leads to job opportunities.

However.

If I had done more research I would have found several reputable boot camps or self-taught routes that are much less expensive. Here are a few:


1. freeCodeCamp.org
2. Scrimba
3. Ada Developers Academy
4. #100Devs
5. HackBright Scholarship programs
6. Udacity NanoDegree certificates
