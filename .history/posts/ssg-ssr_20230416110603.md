**1. DO YOUR RESEARCH**

There are so many boot camps out there. Some with great reputations. A lot with bad. I chose my boot camp - General Assembly - based on several friends' recommendations as well as having a global reputation and network. My boot camp provided a great learning structure and ample career support post-graduation as well as warm leads to job opportunities.

However.

If I had done more research I would have found several reputable boot camps or self-taught routes that are much less expensive. Here are a few:


1. freeCodeCamp.org
2. Scrimba
3. Ada Developers Academy
4. #100Devs
5. HackBright Scholarship programs
6. Udacity NanoDegree certificates

**2. PREPARE BY TAKING INTRO COURSES**

My boot camp required us to complete a mandatory 40-hour intro to web development course covering the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript but the course didn't fit my learning style or complement the boot camp curriculum. I would have been better off completing a Udemy course that gradually helped me integrate the languages into real-world projects. Exactly like what I would eventually be doing in the boot camp. I've since come across so many other, and better, courses that would have taken me the same amount of time and left me more prepared.

So before you start your boot camp, I recommend completing a complete web developer course based on the tech stack you will be learning. Here are a few I'd recommend:

1. FrontEnd Developer
2. Angela Yu - The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp
3. Colt Steele - The Web Developer Bootcamp
