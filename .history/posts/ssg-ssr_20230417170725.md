**1. DO YOUR RESEARCH**

There are so many boot camps out there. Some with great reputations. A lot with bad. I chose my boot camp - General Assembly - based on several friends' recommendations as well as having a global reputation and network. My boot camp provided a great learning structure and ample career support post-graduation as well as warm leads to job opportunities.

However.

If I had done more research I would have found several reputable boot camps or self-taught routes that are much less expensive. Here are a few:


1. [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
2. [Scrimba]
3. [Ada Developers Academy]
4. [#100Devs]
5. [HackBright Scholarship programs]
6. [Udacity NanoDegree certificates]

**2. PREPARE BY TAKING INTRO COURSES**

My boot camp required us to complete a mandatory 40-hour intro to web development course covering the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript but the course didn't fit my learning style or complement the boot camp curriculum. I would have been better off completing a Udemy course that gradually helped me integrate the languages into real-world projects. Exactly like what I would eventually be doing in the boot camp. I've since come across so many other, and better, courses that would have taken me the same amount of time and left me more prepared.

So before you start your boot camp, I recommend completing a complete web developer course based on the tech stack you will be learning. Here are a few I'd recommend:

1. FrontEnd Developer
2. Angela Yu - The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp
3. Colt Steele - The Web Developer Bootcamp

**DOCUMENT YOUR JOURNEY**

Landing your first job in tech is likely going to be much harder than anyone, especially your boot camp, tells you. Is it possible? Of course. In 3 months post-graduation? Sure, for some. But they're the exception. These are the stories you hear though and likely part of the reason you decided on a boot camp in the first place.

How long it takes you to "break into tech" is highly individualized. It's great hearing success stories because it's what gives us all hope and shows us what is possible. But prepare yourself mentally and financially, for taking longer.

One of the best and most efficient ways of getting your first tech role as quickly as possible is, by documenting your journey. You will be learning something new every day. Take the time to write down what it is your learned - the simpler, the better - wherever you keep notes and then share it on LinkedIn, Twitter, and/or a short blog post.

I get that it can be intimidating, but to be frank, no one likely cares that much about your content or thinks about it longer than 2 seconds after reading it. Having content will create a valuable body of work over time that will show recruiters and hiring managers how much you've learned and applied your new skills.

**CONCLUSION**

Deciding to attend a boot camp can be a great way to quickly gain the necessary skills and jumpstart your career in tech. However, it's important to do your research, take introductory courses beforehand and document your journey. Set your expectations for landing your first job in tech and understand that it can take longer than you expect. But if you stay persistent and consistent, you will get there!
